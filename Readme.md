## Data Download

Download extracted features from `[...]`(Due to the email leak problem in the google drive link, we cannot provide the dataset download link under review stage) and move it to the `data` folder.

In the review stage, due to the size limit of the supplementary materials, we can only attach a small part of the dataset to verify that the code is runnable.

## Running the code

Train model using `python train.py` and test model using `python test.py`

You can edit args in these `.py` files
